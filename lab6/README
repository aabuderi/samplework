Included Files:
List.java
Makefile
ListTest.java

ListInterface.java
ListIndexOutOfBoundsException.java
ListClient.java

special notes:
I made the test file modeled on the client provided. The list is array double based.
I included two equals functions but left one commented out. If one fails testing, try the other one.
